# Feature Specification: Future Performance Optimizations

**Feature Branch**: `005-future-performance-optimizations`  
**Created**: 2026-06-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "O(1) Session Lookup by Authentication Token, Zero-Copy Network Serialization on Transmit (Write) Path, Actor-Based Session State (Lock-Free Communication), and Notification Allocation Pooling in Subscriptions."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Fast Session Authentication (Priority: P1)

As a connected client, I want my requests to be authenticated instantly by the server, even when thousands of other clients are communicating concurrently, so that my control commands or data queries are processed without latency spikes.

**Why this priority**: Under high concurrent client connection load, the session validation path is executed for every single request. Using a linear search scales poorly. Resolving this is critical for high-scale SCADA environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by spawning 10,000 concurrent client sessions, each sending high-frequency requests, and measuring the 99th percentile request validation latency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 10,000 active client sessions are connected to the server, **When** a client sends a request with a valid authentication token, **Then** the server locates and validates the session in constant time, achieving sub-1ms lookup latency.
2. **Given** 10,000 active client sessions, **When** multiple clients send requests simultaneously, **Then** session lookup for one client does not lock or delay session lookups for other clients.

### User Story 2 - High-Throughput Outbound Data Transmission (Priority: P1)

As an operator monitoring high-frequency industrial data, I want the server to transmit large volumes of data packets with minimal CPU usage and memory footprint, so that network bandwidth is fully utilized without exhausting system resources.

**Why this priority**: Outbound data serialization is a primary CPU and memory allocation driver. Minimizing copies directly maximizes outbound throughput and overall server capacity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting large data arrays (e.g., 100,000 values) and monitoring the memory allocation rate and CPU usage during packet preparation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client requesting a large dataset, **When** the server prepares and sends the network packet, **Then** the payload is serialized directly into the socket-bound network buffers without intermediate memory copies.
2. **Given** high-throughput data traffic, **When** data is written to the network, **Then** the server does not perform redundant heap memory allocations for each outbound message frame.

### User Story 3 - Lock-Free Session Operations (Priority: P2)

As an industrial control application, I want my session operations (such as reading attributes or updating status) to execute without being blocked by concurrent background tasks (such as publish loops or connection monitoring) on the same session, so that timing-sensitive control loops remain deterministic.

**Why this priority**: Avoids internal lock contention within a single session where multiple async tasks access the session data.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running high-frequency attribute reads, subscription publishing, and status checks on a single session concurrently, verifying that no task blocks or waits on another task.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a session with an active subscription publish loop, **When** the client sends an attribute write request on the same session, **Then** the request is processed concurrently without waiting for a global session read/write lock to release.
2. **Given** multiple tasks interacting with a session, **When** one task stalls or takes longer to execute, **Then** other tasks on the same session are not blocked or deadlocked.

### User Story 4 - Low-Garbage Subscription Notifications (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator running a server for extended periods (months/years), I want value updates on monitored items to be dispatched without causing heap memory fragmentation or continuous garbage collection cycles, so that the server's memory usage remains stable and predictable over time.

**Why this priority**: Repeated allocations and deallocations of notification messages in large subscriptions degrade long-term server stability and performance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a subscription with 50,000 monitored items changing values at 10Hz for 24 hours, and measuring heap usage stability and GC pauses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a subscription monitoring high-frequency value updates, **When** values change and notifications are generated, **Then** the server reuses pre-allocated notification message structures instead of allocating new memory on the heap.
2. **Given** a steady-state operation of value updates, **When** notifications are sent to the client, **Then** the memory allocated for these notifications is recycled back into the pool.

### User Story 5 - Non-Blocking, Bounded Notification Delivery (Priority: P2)

As an operator of a large, alarm-heavy DCS, I want notification and event delivery (data changes, events, and ConditionRefresh replays) to never hold a session-wide lock across an *unbounded* amount of work, so that one large burst — e.g. a ConditionRefresh that replays thousands of retained alarms — cannot stall other clients' or subscriptions' operations on that session.

**Why this priority**: This is an **async-invariant** concern, not merely throughput. The library's name promises non-blocking behaviour on the hot path. Brief sync locks over short, non-awaiting sections are acceptable and deliberate (see the project's lock discipline), but holding the per-session subscription lock while building and enqueuing O(retained conditions × matching items) events defeats that guarantee. **ConditionRefresh** (Part 9 §5.5.7, implemented 2026-06-24) introduced the acute instance: its replay loop runs entirely under `SubscriptionCache`'s per-session `cache.lock()`. The same shape applies to any large event/data-change burst. Left unaddressed, "async" is aspirational on the delivery path under load.

**Independent Test**: Drive a server to a state with thousands of retained alarms; issue a ConditionRefresh from one subscription; measure the lock-hold duration and the 99th-percentile latency of unrelated subscription operations on the same session during the refresh.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** thousands of retained conditions, **When** a client issues ConditionRefresh, **Then** refresh-event production does not hold the session subscription lock for the full build/enqueue duration, and other operations on the session proceed without a proportional latency spike.
2. **Given** a sustained high-rate event/data-change stream, **When** producers outrun the client's Publish consumption, **Then** delivery applies bounded backpressure (ring capacity) rather than unbounded buffering, surfacing overflow via the existing queue-overflow semantics.

**Approach sketch**: per-subscription (or per-source) **bounded SPSC rings** drained by a single **"majordomo"** coordinator task that fans them into Publish responses, preserving per-subscription ordering so `RefreshStart → events → RefreshEnd` stay contiguous. Aligns with the SPSC-ring + majordomo pattern used elsewhere in the consuming PLC ecosystem. **Cheap interim mitigation** (without the full redesign): construct the replay events *outside* the subscription lock — hold only the address-space read lock for construction — and/or chunk the enqueue with cooperative yields.

### Edge Cases

- **Session Closure during Queued Requests**: What happens if a session is closed or times out while requests are actively queued for it? The system must reject the queued requests with a closed session status and discard the queue.
- **Direct Serialization Failure**: How does the system handle serialization errors when writing directly to network buffers? The buffer must be rolled back or discarded safely without leaking memory, and the connection terminated with an error code.
- **Notification Pool Exhaustion**: What happens if the notification object pool is fully exhausted under an extreme burst of value changes? The pool must dynamically allocate new structures to prevent blocking, then shrink back or retain them up to a safe threshold.
- **Priority Message Handling**: How does the session actor handle prioritized messages (e.g., immediate session termination vs. queued read requests)? Urgent lifecycle events must bypass normal message queues to prevent delay.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST authenticate and route incoming client requests to their respective sessions in constant time O(1) relative to the number of active sessions.
- **FR-002**: The session retrieval mechanism MUST NOT lock or block access to other active sessions during lookup.
- **FR-003**: The outbound serialization pipeline MUST encode and frame data directly into the final network transport buffers, avoiding intermediate buffer copies.
- **FR-004**: The network transmitter MUST utilize vectored write operations to send separate message parts (e.g., headers and payloads) without consolidating them into a single contiguous buffer first.
- **FR-005**: Each client session MUST manage its state within an isolated execution boundary (actor), communicating exclusively via asynchronous message queues instead of shared-state locks.
- **FR-006**: The session message processor MUST process queued operations sequentially and support cancellation of pending operations upon session termination.
- **FR-007**: The subscription engine MUST reuse pre-allocated memory structures for value change notifications using a lock-free recycle pool.
- **FR-008**: The notification object pool MUST automatically grow under high demand and return resources to the operating system or reset them to a clean state when idle.
- **FR-009**: Notification/event delivery (data changes, events, and ConditionRefresh replays) MUST NOT hold a session-wide or subscription-wide lock across an unbounded number of items; per-delivery lock-hold time MUST be bounded independent of the number of retained conditions or queued notifications.
- **FR-010**: When producers outrun the client's Publish consumption, the delivery path MUST apply bounded backpressure (fixed-capacity buffering) rather than unbounded growth, surfacing loss through the existing queue-overflow event semantics while preserving per-subscription event ordering.

### Key Entities

- **Session Registry**: A directory that maps authentication tokens to session execution contexts in O(1) time.
- **Session Actor**: A single-threaded logical actor managing session state, processing incoming request messages sequentially.
- **Serialized Outbound Buffer**: A pre-allocated memory buffer that receives encoded protocol frames directly.
- **Notification Pool**: A collection of reusable data change notification objects that are recycled to avoid heap allocation.
- **Delivery Ring + Majordomo**: Per-subscription/per-source bounded SPSC rings feeding a single coordinator task that drains them into Publish responses, decoupling unbounded event production from the lock-held delivery path while preserving per-subscription ordering.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Session lookup time remains below 10 microseconds regardless of the number of active sessions (tested up to 20,000 sessions).
- **SC-002**: Outbound packet preparation achieves zero new heap memory allocations on the hot path (steady state).
- **SC-003**: Average response latency for concurrent session operations is reduced by at least 40% compared to a globally locked session structure under high task contention.
- **SC-004**: Heap memory allocation frequency during subscription updates is reduced by at least 95% under a continuous load of 50,000 monitored items.
- **SC-005**: A ConditionRefresh replaying 10,000 retained conditions holds the session subscription lock for a bounded slice (independent of condition count), and unrelated subscription operations on the same session see no more than a small constant 99th-percentile latency increase during the refresh.

## Assumptions

- The network transport layer supports vectored I/O (scatter/gather writes).
- Clients conform to standard OPC UA session negotiation protocols.
- The operating system allows memory-mapped or pooled buffers without restricting memory pages.
